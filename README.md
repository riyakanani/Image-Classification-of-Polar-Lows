### My contributions:
The parts of the code that I have completed are commented on as "Riya" above the section.

### Background
Polar lows are fast-forming mesocyclones that are capable of reaching hurricane-like forces (Terpstra and Watanabe). The shape of these storms can either be circular with an eye in the center or in the shape of a comma. The ability to identify these storms and notify coastal communities who may be affected could help them better prepare to face the storm's effects.

### Goals
The goal of our research is to improve the identification and classification of Polar Lows using machine learning models by expanding upon our final project from FIRE 198, further developing it to produce more accurate identification results. We will partially accomplish this by implementing a CNN model called AlexNet using the Pytorch framework. This will be used in conjunction with the decision tree classifier. We found a guide for this implementation on GitHub written by Machine Learning Engineer Daniel Bourke (Bourke).

### Motivation
Our motivation is to improve automation the classification of satellite imagery data as a polar low or nonpolar low storm image for the sake of furthering technological improvement.

We are also motivated to help communities affected by polar lows which would be achieved through accurate identificaiton of the storms using satellite imagery.
